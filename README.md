# Thereminimum
A tiny digital theremin I created as a test of the Seeed XIAO thumb-sized microcontrollers and a laser range-finder, as well as battery use and my soldering. 

Hardware required: 
<ul>
  <li>Seeed Studios XIAO ESP32-S3 micricintroller (or equivalent)</li>
  <li>Adafruit VL53L1X laser ranging breakout board (or equivalent)</li>
  <li>Adafruit PS1240 piezo buzzer (or equivalent)</li>
</ul>
All wired up as follows:

Soldered together, it should look something like this:

Since Seeed Studio have somehow managed to cram in battery management to their tiny board, I also attached a small rechargeable battery (3.7V 100mAh 601120) and an on/off dip switch for stand-alone operation:
